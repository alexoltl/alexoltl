# Hi there! I'm Alex, and I like to code.

- I joined github on a different account, made on March 2020 which I lost access to. I wasn't using it anyway, so I made a new account.
- Iâ€™m currently in school, learning digital technologies.
- My main languages are python and java, but I can do a bit of HTML and CSS.
- You can reach me on discord at alexoltl#8251, or send me an email at alexoltlzz@gmail.com
